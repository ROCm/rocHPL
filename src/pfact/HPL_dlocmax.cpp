   * Purpose
   * =======
   *
   * HPL_dlocmax finds  the maximum entry in the current column  and packs
   * the useful information in  WORK[0:3].  On exit,  WORK[0] contains the
   * local maximum  absolute value  scalar,  WORK[1] is the  corresponding
   * local row index,  WORK[2]  is the corresponding global row index, and
   * WORK[3] is the coordinate of the process owning this max.  When N  is
   * less than 1, the WORK[0:2] is initialized to zero, and WORK[3] is set
   * to the total number of process rows.
   *
   * Arguments
   * =========
   *
   * PANEL   (local input/output)          HPL_T_panel *
   *         On entry,  PANEL  points to the data structure containing the
   *         panel information.
   *
   * N       (local input)                 const int
   *         On entry,  N specifies the local number of rows of the column
   *         of A on which we operate.
   *
   * II      (local input)                 const int
   *         On entry, II  specifies the row offset where the column to be
   *         operated on starts with respect to the panel.
   *
   * JJ      (local input)                 const int
   *         On entry, JJ  specifies the column offset where the column to
   *         be operated on starts with respect to the panel.
   *
   * WORK    (local workspace)             double *
   *         On entry, WORK  is  a workarray of size at least 4.  On exit,
   *         WORK[0] contains  the  local  maximum  absolute value scalar,
   *         WORK[1] contains  the corresponding local row index,  WORK[2]
   *         contains the corresponding global row index, and  WORK[3]  is
   *         the coordinate of process owning this max.
