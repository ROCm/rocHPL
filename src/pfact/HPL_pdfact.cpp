void HPL_pdfact(HPL_T_panel* PANEL) {
  /*
   * Purpose
   * =======
   *
   * HPL_pdfact recursively factorizes a  1-dimensional  panel of columns.
   * The  RPFACT  function pointer specifies the recursive algorithm to be
   * used, either Crout, Left- or Right looking.  NBMIN allows to vary the
   * recursive stopping criterium in terms of the number of columns in the
   * panel, and  NDIV allows to specify the number of subpanels each panel
   * should be divided into. Usuallly a value of 2 will be chosen. Finally
   * PFACT is a function pointer specifying the non-recursive algorithm to
   * to be used on at most NBMIN columns. One can also choose here between
   * Crout, Left- or Right looking.  Empirical tests seem to indicate that
   * values of 4 or 8 for NBMIN give the best results.
   *
   * Bi-directional  exchange  is  used  to  perform  the  swap::broadcast
   * operations  at once  for one column in the panel.  This  results in a
   * lower number of slightly larger  messages than usual.  On P processes
   * and assuming bi-directional links,  the running time of this function
   * can be approximated by (when N is equal to N0):
   *
   *    N0 * log_2( P ) * ( lat + ( 2*N0 + 4 ) / bdwth ) +
   *    N0^2 * ( M - N0/3 ) * gam2-3
   *
   * where M is the local number of rows of  the panel, lat and bdwth  are
   * the latency and bandwidth of the network for  double  precision  real
   * words, and  gam2-3  is  an estimate of the  Level 2 and Level 3  BLAS
   * rate of execution. The  recursive  algorithm  allows indeed to almost
   * achieve  Level 3 BLAS  performance  in the panel factorization.  On a
   * large  number of modern machines,  this  operation is however latency
   * bound,  meaning  that its cost can  be estimated  by only the latency
   * portion N0 * log_2(P) * lat.  Mono-directional links will double this
   * communication cost.
   *
   * Arguments
   * =========
   *
   * PANEL   (local input/output)          HPL_T_panel *
   *         On entry,  PANEL  points to the data structure containing the
   *         panel information.
